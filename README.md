### An App to show the state of FBSnapshot Tests.

I think Facebook have [view testing](https://github.com/facebook/ios-snapshot-test-case) right.  So I build
an Xcode plugin, then I decided maybe the plugin isn't the right approach, so I started an app.

#### Main Features

* Showing new images as they're created
* Showing the differences between failed snapshot tests
* Open specific diffs in Kaleidoscope
* Turns red if you've created a view with a zero frame

#### Installation

Will provide a zip.

#### Contributing

It's all UI work, I'm taking a lot of the log parsing from the Xcode plugin.
